1. Algorithms will have problems to distinguish people of this group
   if the distances of the embeddings are smaller.

2. Many examples possible
  - Unblocking the smartphone with a face recognition system might not work or not be secure.
  - Surveillance cameras might confuse indivduals.
  - Social network automated tagging might confuse individuals.

3. Train the model on a balanced dataset with enough samples for each minority.
   If you use pre-trained models, obtain information about the datasets they were pretrained on.
