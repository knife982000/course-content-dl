The network is overfitting as the validation loss does not decrease further even
though the training loss still decreases. The validation loss even increases,
showing that further training is detrimental for the generalisation performance
of the network, hence it is overfitting.

To prevent overfitting, e.g. dropout can be used, as discussed in the next
section.
