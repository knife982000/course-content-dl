An Autoencoder accepts input, compresses it, and recreates it. On the other hand,
VAEs assume that the source data has some underlying distribution and attempts
to find the distribution parameters. So, VAEs are similar to GANs
(but note that GANs work differently, as we will see in the next tutorials).
