    Compute dot products. This is the same operation for each head,
    so we can fold the heads into the batch dimension and use torch.bmm
    Note: .contiguous() doesn't change the actual shape of the data,
    but it rearranges the tensor in memory, which will help speed up the computation
    for this batch matrix multiplication.
    .transpose(dim0, dim1) is used to change the shape of a tensor. It returns a new tensor
    that shares the data with the original tensor. It can only swap two dimension.

    Shape of `queries`: (`batch_size`, no. of queries, head,`k`)
    Shape of `keys`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, head, `k`)
    Shape of `values`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, head, value dimension)

    h: number of heads
    t: number of keys/queries/values (for simplicity, let's assume they have the same sizes)
